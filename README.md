# WarScape
Welcome to the World of WarScape. 

Taking influence from World of Warcraft and RuneScape, this plug in adds a whole new breathe of fresh air to how you can play OldSchool RuneScape.

I am looking to launch the plug in Summer 2023. 

Donations to my Coffee fund are much appreciated!

<p align="center"><B>Concept</b>.</p>

I am a big fan of Risk v Reward and Full Loot systems, this means WarScape will be a High-Risk <b>ONLY</b> Plugin and will only support high-risk worlds.

This system will ensure PvP is rewarding and given how our 'economy' will work, Skilling is just as rewarding. PvM will be king as new gear comes into the 'game'.

An introduction to <b>CLASSES, RACES, FACTIONS AND PROFESSIONS.</b> in WarScape.

In WarScape we're introducing a level cap system, this means you need to think carefully about your build. We will be looking at raising the cap through 'expansions' to keep this experience ever refreshing. 

The reason behind the level cap is competitiveness. We want to keep the battleground as even as possible without anyone being overpowered or others being handicapped for playing their preferred playstyle.

<p align="center"><B>CLASSES</b> in WarScape explained.</p>

| Class | Description | Weapons                        | Armour |
|---|---|--------------------------------| --- |
| Archer| Master of the bow. | Bows, Thorwing knives & Darts. | Leather Armour. |
| Warrior | Master of the Blade. | Short Swords, Long Swords, Daggers & 2Hers. | Chainmail. |
| Mage | Master of Spells. | Staves and Wands | Robes and Spellbooks. |
| Tank | Master of Defence | Any of the above | Platemail + Shields |

As I mentioned above, I've introduced a level cap, this means if you and your friend could pick the same identical class, race and faction but
you leveled your Class stats differently you'll both be at the level cap but one could have higher defence and lower Archery for example.

<p align="center"><B>PROFESSIONS</b> in WarScape explained.</p>

| Profession  | Decription                                  | Skills used          |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Black Smith | Craft weapon and Armour                     | Smithing             |
| Theif       | Pickpocket and steal from the rich          | Thieving & agility   |
 | Miner       | Hard working miners will always be rewarded | Mining               |
| Lumberjack | Gather resources and create arrows, bows and more | Woodcutting & Fletching |
| Huntsman | Hunters track wild animals for great rewards | Hunter & Slayer      |
 | Chef | Provide food for the realm of WarScape | Cooking    |
| Shaman | Crate potions for the realm of WarScape | Herblore             |
| Fisherman | Catch fish, sharks and more | Fishing              |
| Mastercrafter | Craft armour and runes | Crafting & RuneCrafting |
| Farmer | Farm herbs, crops and more | Farming              |
| Carpentry | Build homes and burn logs | Construction & Firemaking |

Professions are highly important to the economy of any game, WarScape is no exception. Everyone is free to use everything, however not everyone can gather everything.

For example: A Fisherman is free to use the Weapons and Armour a Black Smith makes but is unable to make them.
Another example, A Fisherman could trade 10,000 Raw Sharks for some new Rune Armour, the Black Smith can then
sell on the raw Sharks but only a Chef can cook them.

Grand Exchange will be disabled for everyone and I'm working on a solution to prevent resources coming into the game when the
plug in is turned off. 

<p align="center"><B>RACES</b> in WarScape explained.</p>

| Race     | Description                   | Benefit |
|----------|-------------------------------| ------- |
| Elf      | Master theives and huntsman   | Higher Huntsman and theives |
| Dwarfoid | Master miners and Blacksmiths | Higher Mining and Black Smithing |
 | Humans   | Jack of all trades, master of none | Higher in your selected profession |

Races are experimental, they might not even make it into the full release, but I want see if I can make it work.

<p align="center"><B>FACTIONS</b> in WarScape explained.</p>

| Faction | Description                                    |
|---------|------------------------------------------------|
| Noble   | Roam the lands as you please.                  |
 | Plagued | Everyone avoids interactions with the plagued. |
 
Factions are basically 'teams' and will be reflected at the end of 'seasons' and in our seperate hiscores when they launch.
